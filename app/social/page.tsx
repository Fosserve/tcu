              TCU serves as a catalyst for challenging and transforming deeply rooted gender norms and stereotypes. In many communities, girls are viewed as financial burdens and are often married off at a young age to partners who lack the capacity to provide stability. This results in cycles of economic hardship and gender inequality.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-5">
              TCU actively combats these outdated perspectives by providing girls with access to education, leadership training, and life skills. 
              </p>
              <p className="mt-5">
              Studies show that educated girls are six times less likely to be married before the age of 18 compared to those with little or no education. Access to education significantly reduces child marriage rates, as young women are more likely to prioritize career aspirations and personal development over early marriage.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-5">
              Furthermore, education plays a crucial role in reducing domestic violence and gender-based discrimination. Women who receive higher education are more likely to advocate for their rights.
              </p>

              </ul>
              <p className="mt-5">
              Education at TCU goes beyond academicsâ€”it promotes awareness of essential health, sanitation, and reproductive rights. Women with higher education levels are more likely to make informed health decisions, leading to better maternal and child health outcomes. Access to reproductive health education empowers girls to make choices about family planning, reducing unplanned pregnancies and improving overall well-being.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-3">
              TCU also plays a vital role in supporting girls who have faced abuse, neglect, or other social hardships. The institution provides access to counseling, mentorship programs, and support networks that help young women recover from trauma and rebuild their confidence.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-5">
              Through initiatives focused on mental health and personal development, TCU ensures that every girl, regardless of her past experiences, has the opportunity to thrive in a safe and supportive environment
